                        Pokemon trainer Red is quite possibly the second most fammous human in the Pokemon universe, 
                        hanging behind Ash Ketchum simply because of the anime.

                        Kanto. His very first appearance came in the original Pokemon Video Games, Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow.

                        "the Greatest Trainer Ever" or "the True Pokemon Master." He has made a couple appearances 
                        in later games such as HeartGold and SoulSilver, and Pokemon Sun and Moon. Where he is known to always 
                        command a scary strong higher level team of classic generation 1 Pokemon. He also was the main character
